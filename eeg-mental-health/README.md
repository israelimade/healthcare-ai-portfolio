# EEG-Based Mental Health Prediction System

## Project Overview

Machine learning system for predicting depressive episodes using EEG brainwave data. Developed as part of MSc AI thesis with focus on clinical deployment and privacy preservation.

## Technical Achievement
- **95% prediction accuracy** using ensemble methods
- **Privacy-preserving architecture** suitable for NHS deployment
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline** handling incomplete datasets

## Dataset & Approach

**Data Source:** Clinical EEG recordings from patients with diagnosed mental health conditions  
**Challenge:** Incomplete datasets, varying recording quality, privacy constraints  
**Solution:** Custom preprocessing pipeline with advanced signal processing techniques

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Key preprocessing steps implemented:
- EEG signal filtering and noise reduction
- Feature extraction from frequency domains
- Handling missing data points
- Standardization for cross-patient consistency
```

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Spectral features:** Power spectral density across frequency bands
- **Temporal features:** Signal variability and pattern analysis
- **Cross-channel features:** Connectivity between brain regions
- **Clinical features:** Integration with standard assessment scores

### 3. Model Development
**Primary Models:**
- Random Forest (best performance: 95% accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Network ensemble

**Optimization:**
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for robust performance assessment
- Feature importance analysis for clinical interpretability

## Key Technical Innovations

### Privacy-Preserving Design
- **On-device processing:** No raw EEG data transmitted
- **Federated learning ready:** Model updates without data sharing
- **Differential privacy:** Statistical noise injection for anonymization
- **Secure aggregation:** Encrypted model parameter sharing

### Clinical Integration Considerations
- **Real-time processing:** Sub-second prediction latency
- **Interpretable outputs:** Feature importance scores for clinicians
- **Safety mechanisms:** Confidence thresholds and uncertainty quantification
- **Integration APIs:** FHIR-compliant for NHS systems
