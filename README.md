# Healthcare AI Portfolio

**Building ethical, privacy-preserving AI solutions for healthcare delivery**

## Overview

This repository showcases AI-powered healthcare solutions developed with a focus on real-world deployment, data privacy, and public service applications. As an AI technologist with clinical background, I develop systems that bridge cutting-edge technology with practical healthcare constraints.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### EEG Mental Health Prediction System
**Objective:** Develop machine learning models for early detection of depressive episodes using EEG data  
**Impact:** 95% prediction accuracy with privacy-preserving, offline-capable architecture  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, SVM, EEG signal processing  

**Key Features:**
- Ensemble learning approach combining multiple ML algorithms
- Custom preprocessing pipeline for incomplete EEG datasets
- Designed for deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings
- Privacy-by-design architecture suitable for NHS security requirements

### AR Pediatric Rehabilitation Platform
**Objective:** Augmented reality therapy tools for children with neurological conditions  
**Impact:** Evaluated by NHS occupational therapists, improved patient engagement  
**Technologies:** AR development, clinical workflow integration  

**Key Features:**
- User-centered design based on therapist feedback
- Integration with existing clinical assessment protocols
- Gamification elements to improve therapy compliance
- Accessible interface for diverse user capabilities

## üéØ Government AI Applications

### Proposed: NHS Digital Therapy Assistant
**Problem:** Long waiting lists for occupational therapy assessments in UK healthcare  
**Solution:** Open-source conversational AI for initial self-assessment and guidance  

**Technical Approach:**
- Fine-tuned open-source LLM (Llama/Mistral) for healthcare conversations
- On-device processing to ensure patient data privacy
- Integration points with existing NHS patient management systems
- Compliance framework addressing clinical safety requirements

**Why This Matters:**
- Reduces assessment waiting times while maintaining clinical standards
- Transparent, auditable AI that healthcare professionals can trust
- Cost-effective solution scalable across NHS trusts
- Open-source approach enables community-driven improvements

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Ethics Focus

All projects prioritize:
- **Data minimization:** Collect only essential information
- **Transparency:** Open-source, auditable algorithms
- **Security:** Offline-capable, edge-computing architectures
- **Inclusivity:** Designed for diverse populations and resource levels
- **Clinical safety:** Developed with healthcare professional input

## üîß Technical Skills

**AI/ML:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy  
**Healthcare:** EEG signal processing, clinical data standards, FHIR  
**Deployment:** Edge computing, offline-capable systems, cloud infrastructure  
**Ethics:** Privacy-preserving AI, healthcare regulation compliance

## ü§ù Collaboration & Open Source

I believe in:
- **Community-driven innovation** for public benefit
- **Transparent AI development** that stakeholders can understand
- **Cross-disciplinary collaboration** between technologists and healthcare professionals
- **Democratizing access** to healthcare technology regardless of resources
